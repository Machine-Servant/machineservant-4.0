When it comes to building web and mobile applications, developers have a variety of frameworks to choose from. Two of the most popular options are Angular and React.

Angular, developed and maintained by Google, is a comprehensive framework for building web applications. React, on the other hand, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that was developed and maintained by Facebook/Meta.

Both Angular and React have their own set of features and benefits, but which one is better for your project? This article aims to compare Angular and React in terms of performance, features, and popularity, and to help you make an informed decision when it comes to choosing a framework for your next project.

## What is Angular?

[Angular](https://angular.io) is a comprehensive framework for building web applications, developed and maintained by Google. It is built on TypeScript, a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript, and uses a component-based architecture.

This means that Angular applications are composed of reusable components, each with its own logic and view, which work together to create a cohesive whole.

### Two-way Data binding

One of the key features of Angular is its [two-way data binding](https://angular.io/guide/two-way-binding), which allows for real-time updates to the view whenever there is a change in the model.

Two-way data binding makes it easy for developers to create dynamic, responsive user interfaces. Angular also includes a powerful template system, which allows developers to define the structure and layout of their components using HTML.

### Dependency injection

Angular also comes with a rich set of built-in directives and services, such as [dependency injection](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection) and routing, that make it easy to build complex applications.

Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows a developer to provide an external dependency to a class or component, rather than creating it within the class itself. This is useful because it allows for better separation of concerns, making the code more modular and easier to test and maintain.

DI also allows for more flexibility in how dependencies are provided to a class or component, which can make it easier to switch out different implementations of a dependency.

For example, a developer can easily replace a mock service with a real service for testing or replace a development service with a production service without having to change the code that uses the service. This can make the codebase more flexible and adaptable, and also makes it easy to switch out different implementations of a dependency for different environments, such as development and production.

### Community

Angular has a large and active community and a wealth of resources and tutorials available to help developers learn and work with the framework.

### Frameworks built using Angular

Compared to React, Angular is a much more full-fledged framework. As such, there are fewer frameworks built using Angular. But, there are some projects that are worth knowing about when looking at Angular vs React.

#### NestJS

NestJS is a framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications. NestJS is built on top of TypeScript and Express.js, and it follows the principles of Angular to provide a powerful and easy-to-use development experience. NestJS offers a powerful CLI, and it's opinionated, it allows developers to easily create and manage controllers, services, pipes, guards, and more.

If you are considering building a new project in Angular and want to use a NodeJS back-end, NestJS is a good choice because it will feel very familiar to any front-end developers using Angular.

#### Angular Universal

Angular Universal is a framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) Angular applications. It provides a set of tools and features for rendering Angular applications on the server, which can improve the loading performance of web applications.

Angular Universal allows developers to build SEO-friendly applications and improve the user experience for users on low-end devices and slow internet connections.

## Angular vs React: A Comparison

### Performance

Angular and React differ in terms of performance in a few key ways.

#### Two-Way Data Binding

Firstly, Angular uses a two-way data binding, which allows for real-time updates to the view whenever there is a change in the model. This makes it easy for developers to create dynamic, responsive user interfaces, but can lead to increased memory usage and slower performance in large or complex applications.

#### Virtual dom implementation

React, on the other hand, uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This allows React to efficiently update the view when the state of the application changes, leading to faster and more efficient performance.

#### React components vs Angular framework

Another difference is that React uses a component-based architecture, which allows for better code reusability and improved performance in large and complex applications. Angular, on the other hand, uses a more comprehensive framework, which can lead to increased overhead and slower performance in some cases.

#### Server-side rendering

Additionally, React allows for server-side rendering, which can greatly improve the initial load time of a web page, whereas Angular does not.

#### In summary

React performance is generally faster than Angular due to its virtual DOM and component-based architecture, but Angular provides a comprehensive framework that can help to ease the development of large and complex applications with its two-way data binding feature.
