You might have heard of the term "Progressive Web Apps" floating around in the tech world. But what exactly are they? Simply put, PWAs are web applications that use modern web technologies to bring the best of both worlds â€“ the convenience of a website and the functionality of a native app.

You can use a progressive web app as a desktop application or on mobile devices; it will behave like a native app or visit it as a website. In addition, there's no requirement to install web apps like a progressive web application on your mobile devices, so there's a ton of flexibility.

### How do progressive web apps work?

Think of PWAs as a crossbreed between a traditional website and a mobile app. They work on any device, from desktops to smartphones, and are designed to offer a seamless user experience. PWAs use service workers, a web app manifest, and HTTPS to achieve this. Service workers allow PWAs to work offline, web app manifests make it easy to install PWAs on home screens, and HTTPS ensures secure communication between the user and the app.
