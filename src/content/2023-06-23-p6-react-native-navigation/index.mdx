In any application, the ability to customize the look and feel of navigation components is essential. It not only enhances the user experience but also ensures consistency with the application's overall design. This section will introduce you to the realm of customization in React Navigation, where we will discuss how to modify navigation headers, titles, and icons, as well as the theming of navigation components. By the end of this section, you should be able to create a navigation structure that is not only functional but also visually cohesive.

import { ReactNativeNavigationSeriesPage } from '../../components/mdx-components';

<ReactNativeNavigationSeriesNavigation
  currentPage={ReactNativeNavigationSeriesPage.P6}
/>

## Customizing navigation headers and titles

You can customize headers and titles of your screens using the options prop on the Screen components:

```tsx
<Stack.Screen
  name="Home"
  component={HomeScreen}
  options={{
    title: 'My home',
    headerStyle: {
      backgroundColor: '#f4511e',
    },
    headerTintColor: '#fff',
    headerTitleStyle: {
      fontWeight: 'bold',
    },
  }}
/>
```

## Adding icons, images, and other custom components to headers

Adding custom elements such as icons or images to your headers can be done in a similar manner:

```tsx
<Stack.Screen
  name="Home"
  component={HomeScreen}
  options={{
    headerTitle: (props) => <LogoTitle {...props} />, // Custom component
    headerRight: () => (
      <Button
        onPress={() => alert('This is a button!')}
        title="Info"
        color="#00cc00"
      />
    ),
  }}
/>
```

## Styling and theming navigation components

React Navigation supports theming, which allows you to define a set of colors for your navigation components:

```tsx
import { NavigationContainer, DefaultTheme } from '@react-navigation/native';

const MyTheme = {
  ...DefaultTheme,
  colors: {
    ...DefaultTheme.colors,
    primary: 'rgb(255, 45, 85)',
    background: 'rgb(242, 242, 242)',
  },
};

<NavigationContainer theme={MyTheme}>
  {/* rest of your app */}
</NavigationContainer>;
```
